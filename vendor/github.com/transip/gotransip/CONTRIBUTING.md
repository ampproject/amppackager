# Contributing

At TransIP, we encourage open source and therefore can't wait for you to contribute. However, when you file a pull request, please follow some guidelines:

* Take notice of how the current code is written and try to follow the style
* If you're fixing a bug with your PR, explain in detail what went wrong, how the bug is reproducible and confirm your PR fixed it
* Write or improve tests for the code you're touching
* Make sure to write clear and thorough documentation for your code
* Make `go vet` happy and please `go fmt` your code before committing

Thanks! [:heart:](https://transip.nl/jobs/)
