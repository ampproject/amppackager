Opensource Go dependency management does not automatically compile
proto dependencies during 'go install', so providing the pre-compiled
proto is a convenience.

TODO(b/113581454): Copybara does not support a protoc hook.

Therefore, the compiled proto is checked into Piper for the sole
purpose of syncing out to GitHub.

For google3 users, DO NOT IMPORT/RELY on this compiled proto! Use the
standard blaze dependency management.
