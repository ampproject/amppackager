// RewriteAbsoluteURL returns a URL string suitable for the AMP cache's
// view of the given input URL. The resulting "absolute" URL, can be
// one of two possibilies:
//  - an absolute URL pointing to the same coordinates as the {url, base} tuple
//  - the exact text passed into url if the input was malformed,
//    a data: URL, or if we are inside a mustache template. The runtime must
//    fix-up URLs inside mustache templates on the client, as only the runtime
//    knows how to expand the templates.
//
// base is derived from the <base> tag and document URL for the origin document.
//
// url is the original href value. It may be absolute, host-relative,
// path-relative, or fragment-relative. It could be a data: URL, it could
// be empty, it could be grotesquely malformed. It came from the internet.
// If relative, it is relative to base.

	// path (beginning with '//') this is a clear statement that either
	// HTTP or HTTPS can work. Special-case the protocol-relative case.

		// and send the user away when we could have kept them on the page they
		// already loaded for a better experience.
