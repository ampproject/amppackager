# Contributing Guidelines

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as

use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult

# Getting Started

## Running a development server

Copy `amppkg.example.toml` to `amppkg.toml` and modify it to suit your needs.
You may use `testdata/b1/server.{cert,privkey}` to get started. However, you are
at your own risk if you instruct your browser to trust `server.cert`. *NEVER*
instruct your browser to trust `ca.cert`.

# Suggestions for contributions

Take a look at [good first
issues](https://github.com/ampproject/amppackager/labels/good%20first%20issue),
and please communicate early and often, to ensure we agree on the solution
before you invest a lot of time into its implementation.
